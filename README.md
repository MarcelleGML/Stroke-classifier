# Stroke-classifier
This project aims to predict whether a patient will have a heart stroke or not based on their comorbidities, work, and lifestyle factors. The analysis of such data and the development of prediction models are valuable in the healthcare sector. By working on this project, you will gain a better understanding of data analysis, data cleaning, data visualizations, and algorithms.

## Dataset
The stroke data used in this project is sourced from Kaggle. The dataset includes various features such as gender, age, glucose level, BMI, smoking status, and other comorbidities. The target variable is the occurrence of a stroke. Each row in the dataset represents a patient's relevant information. The following features are included in the dataset:

-Gender
-Age
-Glucose Level
-BMI (Body Mass Index)
-Smoking Status
-Other Comorbidities

## Goals
The main objectives of this project are:

Perform data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure the dataset's quality and reliability.
Conduct exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the distribution and relationships among the variables.
Apply various machine learning algorithms to build prediction models for heart stroke.
Evaluate and compare the performance of different models using appropriate metrics.
Create data visualizations to effectively communicate the findings and model results.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

- data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset
